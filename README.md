# Smart Alarm Clock: Mathematical Challenge with Voice Recognition

An STM32-based alarm clock system that combines mobile connectivity with an engaging wake-up verification method. When the alarm triggers, it displays a pre-stored mathematical problem on an LCD screen. Users must solve the problem and speak the answer correctly to silence the alarm.

## Key Features:
- **Custom Mobile App**: Allows remote alarm management and configuration.
- **Bluetooth Communication**: Enables seamless connectivity with the STM32 microcontroller.
- **LCD Display**: Presents mathematical problems to the user.
- **Pre-Stored Mathematical Problems**: Provides a variety of challenges to solve.
- **Voice Recognition**: Verifies spoken answers to silence the alarm.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Ideal for heavy sleepers and those seeking an engaging wake-up routine.
